# Titanic-Kaggle
The Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his/her name,age,sex,passenger,class,ticket,embarked,parched ,etc. I have been playing with the Titanic dataset for a while, and I have recently achieved an accuracy score of 0.83253(Best Solution-third notebook) on the public leaderboard.  I am ranked among the top 2% of 10000+ teams competing

In a form of a jupyter notebook, my solution goes through the basic steps of a data science pipeline:

Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
Data cleaning
Feature engineering
Modeling
